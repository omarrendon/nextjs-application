This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Target of this project

This is a Next Js project, where I use some benefits of Next Js, like getStaticProps to fecth data from an external API
and create dynamics routes with getStaticsPaths.
